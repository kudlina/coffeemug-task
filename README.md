Hi!
This is my solution for task: "E-commerce Website Testing".

Few assumptions regarding functionalities listed in the task:

1. User Registration and Login

- Valid username means that it's unique - it's not present in the database
- Valid password is 6 characters long, one capital letter, one number, one special character required
- Login form requires username and password (most common scenario)

2. Product Search and Filter

- The search results page has heading which states what search phrase was used (usually in e-commerce websites)
- Each product is displayed as a card
- Available filter is "category"
